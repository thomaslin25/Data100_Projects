The scores and violation information have been made available by the San Francisco Department of Public Health. The main goal for this assignment is to understand how restaurants are scored.

Grouping by name would group together all the records sharing the same name, so potentially restaurants with the same name (e.g. members of a chain restaurant) would have their records grouped together. Meanwhile, grouping by address would group all restaurants of the same address together, which should have some change on the data, as shown by running a similar test to Question 2a.

We can use this information for further analysis to compare how restaurants perform in routine inspections vs. inspections that are performed due to a complaint. A potential factors to consider with these data points would be whether or not the restaurant was expecting the inspection or not, such as if they know when the routine inspections occur or when they have a complaint filed against them. Unfortunately, there is only one record for a complaint inspection, so the sample size is relatively so small it may be difficult to draw meaningful conclusions from comparison. "

    "Let's look at the distribution of inspection scores. As we saw before when we called `head` on this data frame, inspection scores appear to be integer values. The discreteness of this variable means that we can use a barplot to visualize the distribution of the inspection score. Make a bar plot of the counts of the number of inspections receiving each score. \n",
    "\n",
    "It should look like the image below. It does not need to look exactly the same (e.g., no grid), but make sure that all labels and axes are correct.\n",

    "The distribution of the inspection scores seems to be increasing towards the higher scores. The mode of the scores is 100 and the higher the score, the more common it was to be given. There are a few gaps, especially in the high 90s, and nothing below 48. This observed trend implies that it is more common for most restaurants to have generally high inspection scores. This makes sense as if a restaurant were to have too low of an inspection score, it would be unlikeley to remain in business successfully, so there are more restaurants with higher scores as they are able to stay in business.

    "\n",
    "Another way to compare the scores from the two inspections is to examine the difference in scores. Subtract the first score from the second in `scores_pairs_by_business`. Make a histogram of these differences in the scores. We might expect these differences to be positive, indicating an improvement from the first to the second inspection.\n",
    "\n",
    "The histogram should look like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"q7d.png\" width=500>\n",
    "\n",
    "*Hint*: Use `second_score` and `first_score` created in the scatter plot code above.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Hint*: Convert the scores into numpy arrays to make them easier to deal with.\n",
