    "In this project, you will use what you've learned in class to create a classifier that can distinguish spam (junk or commercial or bulk) emails from ham (non-spam) emails. In addition to providing some skeleton code to fill in, we will evaluate your work based on your model's accuracy and your written responses in this notebook.\n",

    "- Using sklearn libraries to process data and fit models\n",
    "- Validating the performance of your model and minimizing overfitting\n",

In order to get full credit on the accuracy part of this assignment, you must get at least **88%** accuracy on the test set.

I then investigated other features, such as length of email, length of subject, and proportion of words that were lowercase or uppercase. I judged features to be better by the training and validation accuracies. \n",
    "2. Certain words that had a high difference in frequency of appearance between spam and ham had a large impact on the model accuracy. However, other words did not have a similar impact. Some words were redundant, and including both features did not improve model accuracy despite each independently affecting the accuracy. The proportion of uppercase words was not helpful because it turns out that the email text was presented in a way such that none of the words began with capitalized letters.\n",
    "3. I was surprised that some words had no effect on the accuracy of the model, despite a large disparity in the difference between frequency in appearance between spam and ham. I realize now that it's unlikely that these words would have an impact as they didn't have a total high appearance rate in the email set, but it was still surprising to me that they resulted in 0 difference in accuracy overall. I was also surprised to find all the words were lowercase."

    "### Question 9: ROC Curve\n",
    "\n",
    "In most cases we won't be able to get no false positives and no false negatives, so we have to compromise. For example, in the case of cancer screenings, false negatives are comparatively worse than false positives — a false negative means that a patient might not discover a disease until it's too late to treat, while a false positive means that a patient will probably have to take another screening.\n",
    "\n",
    "Recall that logistic regression calculates the probability that an example belongs to a certain class. Then, to classify an example we say that an email is spam if our classifier gives it $\\ge 0.5$ probability of being spam. However, *we can adjust that cutoff*: we can say that an email is spam only if our classifier gives it $\\ge 0.7$ probability of being spam, for example. This is how we can trade off false positives and false negatives.\n",
    "\n",
    "The ROC curve shows this trade off for each possible cutoff probability. In the cell below, plot an ROC curve for your final classifier (the one you use to make predictions for Kaggle). Refer to the Lecture 22 notebook or Section 17.7 of the course text to see how to plot an ROC curve.\n",
